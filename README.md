## Summary

Please use hardcoded values in place of the API for now as I've only got this running on localhost whilst I make tweaks.

You will be able to fetch these variables from the API:
* Supply of each NFT category (int)
* USDC price of each NFT category (float)
* Solana price of eah NFT category (float)
* Solana Network Status (String) - Normal, Slow, Offline

I'm not sure if you're familiar with how web3 wallets work but if you have any questions just let me know either via Peter or my email is harryjamesrobson02@gmail.com 

I've included the Solana network status variable as sometimes Solana can crash or be very slow. It might be worth displaying a banner when slow and disabling buttons when offline just to stop any user confusion but that's up to you guys.
